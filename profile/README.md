పుష్పా 2 The Rule Movie Release Live Updates: Three years back when Pushpa 1 hit the screens, not many could predict the kind of impact it would have on Indian cinema. The film about the rise of a gutsy nobody to the top echelons of a smuggling syndicate found resonance across the country. Among its many box-office achievements, Pushpa also made history by making Allu Arjun the first male Telugu actor to receive a National Award for Best Actor. In fact, in an interview on Nandamuri Balakrishna’s Unstoppable with NBK, Allu Arjun spoke about how it was very distressing to not see a single male Telugu actor’s name in the Best Actor list, and Pushpa’s role in making history. Finally, the journey that started in December 2021 will come full circle this December as పుష్పా 2: The Rule is set to hit theatres on Thursday.

Despite various controversies surrounding పుష్పా 2, including a purported tiff between director Sukumar and Allu Arjun, and a public spat between composer Devi Sri Prasad and producers Mythri Movie Makers, the film has been completed, and is gearing up for a blockbuster opening. Major credit to the hype surrounding the film has to go to the intense promotional drive spearheaded by Allu Arjun and Rashmika Mandanna. They kept the movie in the news for the past couple of weeks by relentless promotions in cities like Patna, Kochi, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Mumbai.

Apart from Allu Arjun, other actors who would be reprising their roles from the first installment include Rashmika Mandanna, Fahadh Faasil, Rao Ramesh, Anasuya Bhardwaj, Sunil, Ajay Ghosh, Prathap Bhandari, and Dhananjaya.

Even as other things changed around them, and the ensemble continued to star in other projects, Sukumar and Allu Arjun were completely focussed on the two Pushpa films, which first went on floors in December 2019 just weeks before the country was shut down due to the global pandemic. Since then, both these top-tier talents have been putting all their efforts to ensure Pushpa is a film that Indian cinema can be proud of. And in a few hours, we’d know if their vision comes true.
